    <h2>About characters: </h2>
        <p class="tomi"> 
            &#8594;Thomas Michael Shelby is a fictional character
            and the protagonist of the British period crime drama Peaky Blinders.
            He is played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who has won an Irish Film &
            Television Award and National Television Award for his portrayal of Shelby.
            The character has received critical acclaim.</p>
        <p class="artur">
            &#8594;Arthur Shelby was killed and resurrected in Peaky Blinders, season 4, episode 6,
            but had his death been permanent there would have been dire consequences for the Shelby family.
            In season 3, Arthur killed Vicente Changretta, driving his son, Luca, to declare a vendetta against
            the Shelbys in season 4. After Arthur’s “death”, the vendetta appeared lost, but his unexpected revival
            allowed the Peaky Blinders to use the element of surprise to their advantage. The vendetta ended
            after Luca was shot in head; crucially, Arthur was the one who fired the gun.
